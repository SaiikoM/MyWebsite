  <h3>Japanese Cuisine</h3>
<p>Japanese Cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan, which have developed through
  centuries of political, economic, and social changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan(Washoku) is based on
  rice with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients. Side dishes often consist
  of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also
  served raw as Sashimi or Sushi. It is also Japan's national dish.</p>

<h3>Why is Japanese food popular?</h3>
<p>The show explains the reason why Japanese food became extremely popular in America is not only
  because of the healthy ingredients and seasonings used in Japanese food but also being able to use chopsticks
  is considered "cool".</p>

<h3>Is Japanese food healthy?</h3>
<p>A traditional Japenese diet is well balanced, featuring more fish than red meat, plenty of vegetables, pickled
  and fermented foods, and small portions of rice. It involves little highly processed food and lower overall
  sugar intake. Basically, the Japanese diet is low in calories and extremely nutritious.</p>

  <h3>Typical Japanese Meal</h3>
  <p>The typical Japenese meal consists of a bowl of rice(gohan), a boul of miso soup(miso shiru), pickled vegetables
    (tsukemono) and fish or meat. While rice is the staple food, several kinds of noodles(udon, soba and ramen) are
    cheap and very popular for light meals</p>

    <h2>The best places in Japan to eat</h2>

    <h3>1. Shimoda: Seafood Wonderland</h3>
      <p>Located on the southern point of the Izu peninsula about four hours from Tokyo is the humble port town
        of Shimoda. As well as being a scenic retreat from the manic energy of city life, it’s also where
        you’ll find some of the best seafood in the whole entire world. The town is home to a number of fish
        markets, while local restaurants specialize in squid, baked fish and kinmedai – a crispy golden
        eye snapper that’s quickly gaining a lot of popularity internationally.</p>

<h3>2. Hokkiado: Dairy, Especially Cheese</h3>
<p>If you head up to the more northern area of Japan you’ll get to Hokkaido prefecture. The capital is
  the chilly city of Sapporo, home to some of the most exciting winter festivals and the best dairy
  products in Japan. Japan may not be know for its cheeses, Hokkaido does in fact actually produce
  delicious world-class cheese.</p>

<h3>3. Morioka: Wanko Soba, little tiny bowls of soba</h3>
<p>In Japan soba noodles(buckwheat) are not unique, however the city of Morioka in Iwate Prefecture does
  soba a little differently. Known as  ‘wanko soba’, this dish is essentially an eating competition
  disguised as a meal. In the local dialect ‘wanko’ means ‘bowls’, and here in Morioka soba is served
  in stacks of tiny little bowls.</p>

  <h3>4. Osaka: Takoyaki 'Octopus Balls'</h3>
<p>Sometimes considered Tokyo's cool grittier cousin, Osaka has a lot going for it but it's their Takoyaki
  that really brings the masses. Often refered to in English as 'fried octopus balls', Takoyaki is the perfect
  on-the-go, after drinking, during drinking and everything in-between snack. It's like a traditional form of
  fast food.</p>

<h3>5. Okinawa: Umibudo, little salty sea grapes</h3>
<p>Okinawa is a fascinating island. It's home to the most stunning beaches in the world and some of the longest
  living locals too, so they must be doing something right sea grapesa. Sea grapes are considered a common snack,
  this strange type of seaweed consists of tiny little salty beads that bust and release a slightly salty taste of
  the sea.</p>

<h3>6. Kobe: Kobe Beef</h3>
<p>Kobe is probably the most famous beef in the world, and is a prized Japanese delicacy and probably the most
  widely-known regional speciality food in Japan. One of the many breeds of Wagyu, aka Japanese cattle, Kobe
  beef is always tender, and flavourful and marbled with fat. The most common way to enjoy Kobe beef is in
  shabu shabu (a soup filled with boiled meat), sukiyaki (Japanese hot pot) or teppanyaki, where the chef
  grills the meat in front of his guests.</p>

<h3>7. Yokohama: Ramen</h3>
<p>Located only 40 minutes from Tokyo, Yokohama is the capital city’s often overlooked cousin,
  but if you’re visitng Tokyo don’t miss an opportunity to pop by. Yokohama is arguably home
  to the most food museums in the country, one of which includes the ramen museum. It makes
  sense because it’s one of the most underrated ramen centres of the world. Legend has it
  that the first Japanese ramen shop actually opened here in Yokohama. Since its beginning the
  city’s ramen scene has developed a lot, so much so there’s not just a museum but also an
  dedicated ramen festival that happens every year.</p>

  <h3>8. Nikko: Yuba, weird but delicious tofu skin</h3>
  <p>When in Nikko the one food you have to try is yuba. Basically a version of tofu, or more
    graphically, a food made from the surface skin that forms on top of soy milk when it gets
    hot, it sounds disgusting but tastes delicious. Yuba’s greatest appeal is its versatility – like tofu,
    it reflects the flavours in which its cooked but with a much more interesting, chewy texture. The best
    way to eat it is as the local suggest in a bowl of hot noodles.</p>

<h3>9. Fukuoka: Infamous But Delicious Fugu</h3>
<p>Fugu is a bit of an urban legend on the culinary scene, but it does very much exist, and the best place
  to find it is in Fukuoka. This delicious (though deadly if you don’t cook it right) blowfish is easily
  accessible for a decent price here in the capital of Kyushu Island. Whether you want it in a hot pot,
  sashimi style, or fried, you can get it in Fukuoka.</p>
